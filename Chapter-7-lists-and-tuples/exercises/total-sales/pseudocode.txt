Design a program that asks the user to enter a store's sales for each day of the week.
The amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week
and display the results.

TOTAL SALES PSEUDOCODE

SET DAYS_OF_WEEK = 7
SET SALES_FOR_WEEK.SIZE = DAYS_OF_WEEK
SET input_for_day
SET total_sales = 0

DISPLAY PROMPT "Enter the total sales for the week"
FOR DAY in SALES_ARRAY:
    DISPLAY "Enter total sales for day DAY"
    USER ENTER input_for_day for current DAY
        VALIDATE input_for_day is NOT negative
INCREMENT DAY
REPEAT UNTIL DAY >= DAYS_OF_WEEK

DISPLAY "Calculating the sales for the week
FOR DAY in SALES_ARRAY
    CALCULATE total_sales
DISPLAY "Total Sales is $" + total_sales
