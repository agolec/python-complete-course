top down design breaks a program into it's functions.

The overall task that the program is to perform is broken down into a series of subtasks.

Each of the subtasks is examined to determine whether it can be further broken down into more subtasks.
This step is repeated until no more subtasks can be identified.

Once all the subtasks have been identified, they are written into code.

This process is  called top down design because the programmer/s begin by looking at the top-most level 
of tasks that must be performed and then breaks those tasks into lower levels of subtasks.
